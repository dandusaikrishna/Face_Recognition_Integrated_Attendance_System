# Face Recognition Integrated Attendance System


My project addresses a challenge faced by college faculty: frequently taking attendance every hour to maintain
security protocols, which can be stressful.
● The system is trained once during student registration and uses Python's Tkinter for the interface, with NumPy
and Pandas for attendance data manipulation.
● In the first class of the morning, it records attendance for all students present in the classroom by capturing
images from CCTV and marks it in the database.An hour later, it captures student faces again to identify any
mismatches and notifies the class teacher of these students along with their roll numbers via email.
● Provided real-time updates with attendance logs on the main screen, enhancing monitoring efficiency, and
automated the process of sending daily attendance data via email to the respective faculty.
